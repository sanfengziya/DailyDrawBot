# DailyDrawBot
ðŸŽ² A Discord bot for daily lucky draws and point tracking.

Set the Discord bot token using an environment variable named `TOKEN` before
running the bot. If you deploy on Railway, add `TOKEN` to your service's
environment variables and Railway will pass it to the process automatically.
When running locally you can export the variable first, e.g.:

```bash
export TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN"
python bot.py
```
